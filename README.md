### Brand Colors & Design Tokens

We use explicit brand tokens (`--color-brand-*`, `--color-accent-pink-*`) instead of overriding Tailwind’s semantic color tokens (`green`, `emerald`). This keeps `green`/`emerald` for real success/affirmative semantics (e.g. status indicators) and reserves brand purple/pink for brand-specific UI. Components should use `bg-brand-*`, `text-brand-*`, `bg-accent-pink-*` etc. for brand styling.

## 📁 Architecture

The project follows a modern monorepo-style structure optimized for Convex and Next.js:

- `convex/`: Backend schema, mutations, actions, and AI logic.
- `src/app/`: Next.js 16 routes and page layouts.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components (Shared, Audio Player, AI Features).
- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks for audio management and state.
- `src/lib/`: Utility functions and third-party configurations.
